If we use in-order traversal to serialize a binary search tree, we can
get a list of values in ascending order. It can be proved with the
definition of BST. And here I use the reference of TreeNode
pointer prev as a global variable to mark the address of previous node in the
list.

If you know what INT_MAX or INT_MIN is, then it is no excuse for your carelessness.
