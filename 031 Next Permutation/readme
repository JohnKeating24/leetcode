Well, in fact the problem of next permutation has been studied long ago. 
From the Wikipedia page, in the 14th century, a man named Narayana Pandita gives the following classic and
yet quite simple algorithm 
(with minor modifications in notations to fit the problem statement):

1.Find the largest index k such that nums[k] < nums[k + 1]. 
  If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, just reverse it to ascending order and we are done. 
  For example, the next permutation of [3, 2, 1] is [1, 2, 3]. 
2.Find the largest index l greater than k such that nums[k] < nums[l].
3.Swap the value of nums[k] with that of nums[l].
4.Reverse the sequence from nums[k + 1] up to and including the final element nums[nums.size()-1].
