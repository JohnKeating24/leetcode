// forward scan to calculate how many candies needed for child i to make sure it has more candies than its left neighbor 
  if it has a higher rate, otherwise, give one candy to it
// backward scan to calculate to make sure child i has more candies than its right neighbor if it has a higher rate, 
  pick the bigger one from forward and backward scans as the final number for child i

//写得很简洁，把三个for循环写成了两个。
