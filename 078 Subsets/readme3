This problem can also be solved iteratively. Take [1, 2, 3] in the problem statement as an example. The process of generating all the subsets is like:

Initially: [[]]
Adding the first number to all the existed subsets: [[], [1]];
Adding the second number to all the existed subsets: [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]];
Adding the third number to all the existed subsets: [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]].
