The workflow of the solution is as below.

1. Scan the string from beginning to end.
2. If current character is '(',push its index to the stack. 
   If current character is ')' and the character at the index of the top of stack is '(', 
   we just find a matching pair so pop from the stack. 
   Otherwise, we push the index of ')' to the stack.
3. After the scan is done, the stack will only contain the indices of characters which cannot be matched. 
   Then let's use the opposite side - substring between adjacent indices should be valid parentheses.
4. If the stack is empty, the whole input string is valid. 
   Otherwise, we can scan the stack to get longest valid substring as described in step 3.


take   ()())() for example:
index：0123456   n=7
a=4 表示index4左边已经匹配好的长度
7-4-1 表示index4右边已经匹配好的长度；减去的1表示index=4的括号本身。
