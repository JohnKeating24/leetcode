Well, life gets difficult pretty soon whenever the same operation on array is transferred to linked list.

First, a quick recap of insertion sort:

Start from the second element (simply a[1] in array and the annoying head -> next -> val in linked list), 
each time when we see a node with val smaller than its previous node, we scan from the head and find the position that
the current node should be inserted. Since a node may be inserted before head, we create a new_head that points to head. 
The insertion operation, however, is a little easier for linked list.

/* Insert cur -> next after pre.*/

/* Move pre back to new_head. */
