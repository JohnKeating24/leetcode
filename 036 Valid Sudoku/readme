Three flags are used to check whether a number appear.
used1: check each row
used2: check each column
used3: check each sub-boxes

// k = i / 3 * 3 + j / 3   if(i,j)=(4,5),then k=1*3+1=4;
The beauty of the formula given is that all x/y indices within one box yield the same number. 
Essentially, k is mapping the 9x9 grid into a 3x3 grid of boxes like below:
0 | 1 | 2
3 | 4 | 5
6 | 7 | 8

Lets look at i=5, j=6 (bottom left index of the "right-center" box):
k = 5 / 3 * 3 + 6 / 3 = 1*3+2=5

Now lets take a look at i=6, j=5 (top right index of the "bottom-center" box:
k= 6 / 3 * 3 + 5 / 3 = 2*3+1=7
